Movie Rating Prediction with Python
This project demonstrates building a predictive model for movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, actors, and more. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and accurately estimate IMDb ratings.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on Indian movies, including:

Movie name
Year of release
Duration
Genre
IMDb rating
Number of votes
Director and lead actors
File Details:
Uploaded Dataset: movie.xlsx (Preprocessed version)
Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical data (e.g., genre, director, actors).
Converting numeric columns stored as strings to the appropriate format.
Model Building:

Regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were explored.
Evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² Score.
Outcome:

A trained model capable of predicting IMDb ratings based on input features.
Repository Content
Dataset: Preprocessed movie.xlsx file.
Code: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Documentation: Step-by-step instructions and insights into the modeling process.
Steps to Reproduce
